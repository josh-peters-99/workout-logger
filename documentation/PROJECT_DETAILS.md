## Architectural Stack
- Frontend: Vite (JavaScript)
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot) with REST APIs
- Database: DynamoDB
- Serverless: AWS Lambda and API Gateway

### AWS Setup
- Use **S3** and **CloudFront** for the frontend.
- Use **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway** for a serverless backend.
- Use **DynamoDB** with free tier for your database.
- Automate deployment for both environments (beta and production) using CI/CD pipelines with **AWS CodePipeline** (free tier available).
