# Project Plan for Workout Logger App

## 1. Create the UI/UX Design using Figma

### Design the User Interface (UI):
- [ ] Create wireframes for each page of your workout tracker app, such as:
  - [ ] Home Page (login/signup forms, workout dashboard).
  - [ ] Workout Log Page (view and create new workouts).
  - [ ] Progress Analytics Page (charts and graphs for tracking).
- [ ] Use Figma to design each component, focusing on:
  - Color Scheme
  - Typography (simple and readable fonts)
  - Layout (user-friendly, intuitive navigation)
  - Responsiveness (ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes)
- [ ] Design Interactive Prototypes:
  - Create clickable prototypes to simulate the user flow and interaction between pages.
  - Test the flow with potential users or teammates for feedback.
  - Ensure that the design has an intuitive experience with clear aactions (e.g., buttons, navigation).
- [ ] Export Assets
  - Export icons, images, and other assets needed for your frontend development.

## 2. Initialize the Project Structure

### Frontend:
- [ ] Create a Next.js project:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest workout-logger-frontend --typescript
  ```
- [ ] Set up the folder structure (e.g., components, pages, styles).
- [ ] Commit the initial setup to your repository

### Backend:
- [ ] Use Spring Initializr to create your Spring Boot project with dependencies for:
  - Spring Web (for REST APIs)
  - Spring Data JPA (for database interaction)
  - PostgreSQL Driver
  - Spring Security (for authentication/authorization)
- [ ] Commit the backend project structure to your repository

## 3.  Design the Database Schema

- [ ] Define the tables for your workout tracker:
  - Example tables:
    1. `users` (id, name, email, hashed_password)
    2. `workouts` (id, user_id, date, type, duration)
    3. `exercises` (id, workout_id, name, sets, reps, weight)
  - Use an ERD tool like dbdiagram.io to visualize your schema
- [ ] Configure your PostgreSQL database on RDS and connect it to the Spring Boot backend.

## 4. Set Up AWS Infrastructure

- Infrastructure as Code:
  - [ ] Use **Boto3** to script the creation of:
    - [ ] EC2 instances for the backend.
    - [ ] RDS PostgreSQL database.
    - [ ] Load balancers and auto-scaling groups.
  - [ ] Set up your AWS Lambda function environment for serverless tasks (e.g., scheduled job for weekly summaries).
 
## 5. Build the Frontend UI

- [ ] Implement the frontend UI using Figma designs as the reference:
  - [ ] Design key pages for the app:
    - [ ] User authentication (login/sign-up).
    - [ ] Dashboard to view workout logs.
    - [ ] Form to log new workouts and exercises.
    - [ ] Analytics (charts/graphs for progress tracking).
- [ ] Implement responsive design based on Figma's mobile/tablet/desktop mockups.

## 6. Build Backend REST APIs

- [ ] Create endpoints for:
  - [ ] User registration and login.
  - [ ] CRUD opperations for workouts and exercises.
  - [ ] Fetching user-specific analytics.
- [ ] Test APIs using **Postman** or **cURL**.

## 7. Integrate Frontend and Backend

- [ ] Set up API routes in Next.js to communicate with the backend.
- [ ] Use **Axios** or **Fetch API** to make HTTP requests.
- [ ] Ensure secure communication using **JWT authentication**.

## 8. Add CI/CD Pipelines

- [ ] Use **GitHub Actions** to automate:
  - Linting and testing on pull requests.
  - Deployment to AWS.

## 9. Implement Scalable Features

- [ ] Add auto-scaling groups for the EC2 backend to handle high traffic.
- [ ] Configure a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic.

## 10. Test and Optimize

- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing (frontend to backend to database).
- [ ] Load test your backend using tools like **JMeter** or **k6**.
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API responses.

## 11. Deploy

- [ ] Deploy the backend on **EC2** and **RDS**.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend on **AWS Amplify** or **S3 + CloudFront** for scalability.
- [ ] Use **AWS Lambda** for serverless functions.

## 12. Monitor and Maintain

- [ ] Set up monitoring for your services:
  - [ ] Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for logs and metrics.
  - [ ] Configure alerts for potential issues (e.g., high CPU usage, database connections).
